# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Using Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. Being able to predict credit risk with machine learning algorithms can help banks and financial institutions predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud.

## Background

#### Machine Learning - 
Machine learning is the use of statistical algorithms to perform tasks such as learning from data patterns and making predictions. There are many different modelsâ€”a model is a mathematical representation of something that happens in the real world. Broadly speaking, machine learning can be divided into three learning categories: supervised, unsupervised, and deep.
